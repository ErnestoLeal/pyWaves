# Tone Generation with Python and a Waveform Generator

## Overview

This project, part of a GE-Lab course, focuses on generating tones and waveforms using Python to communicate with a **Keysight 33510B Waveform Generator**. It includes modular Python scripts for tone generation and music playback, with each function isolated in separate files for clarity and maintainability.

### Features

- **Modular Structure**: Functions are organized in separate files, enhancing readability and modularity.
- **Waveform Variety**: Supports multiple waveform types (sine, square, etc.) for flexible tone generation.
- **Music Playback**: Plays musical scales and predefined pieces, including a national anthem.

## Project Structure

- **noteDictionary.py**: Contains a dictionary mapping musical notes to their frequencies, allowing easy access to notes by name.
- **functionDictionary.py**: Defines available waveform functions as dictionary entries, which map keywords to waveform generator commands.
- **playNote.py**: Plays a specified note with configurable duration and waveform type, utilizing the dictionaries in `noteDictionary` and `functionDictionary`.
- **scale.py**: Plays a full musical scale, demonstrating the use of different waveforms on the generator.
- **anthem.py**: Plays a national anthem or another specific music piece as defined within the file.
- **setupSource.py**: Handles the setup of communication with the waveform generator, including connection, configuration, and resource management.

## How It Works

This project leverages Python's PyVISA library to communicate with the waveform generator, allowing the user to generate and play tones with customized waveforms.

1. **Initialize Connection**:
   - `setupSource.py` establishes communication with the waveform generator, ensuring it’s ready for tone generation.

2. **Play a Scale**:
   - `scale.py` uses `playNote` to play a predefined musical scale, allowing the user to experiment with different waveforms.

3. **Play a National Anthem**:
   - `anthem.py` plays the national anthem or any specific music piece, configured using the notes and waveforms from `noteDictionary` and `functionDictionary`.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**:
  - **pyvisa**: For communication with the waveform generator
  - **time**: For delays between note generation

  To install PyVISA, run:
  ```bash
  pip install pyvisa
  ```

## Usage

### Initialize the Waveform Generator Connection

1. Ensure the waveform generator is connected and powered on.
2. Run `setupSource.py` to configure the connection and initialize parameters.

### Play a Scale

Run `scale.py` to play a musical scale using the waveform generator. This file demonstrates various waveforms as defined in `functionDictionary.py`.

### Play a National Anthem

Run `anthem.py` to play a national anthem or another predefined piece of music on the waveform generator.

## Example

Here’s an example of how to play a note using the `playNote.py` function:

```python
from playNote import play_note

# Parameters: note, duration, speed, waveform
play_note('A4', 1, 100, 'sine')
```

This command plays the note **A4** (440 Hz) for **1 second** at **100 BPM**, using a sine waveform.

## Notes

- **Modular Design**: This project follows a modular design, with each function separated into distinct files for clarity and maintainability. Although it does not strictly follow OOP principles, it organizes functionality into reusable, independent components.
- **Improved Code Quality**: This implementation uses cleaner, more efficient functions for note and waveform generation, ensuring readability and reusability.

## Future Updates

- **Extended Music Library**: Additional music pieces and scales for more variety.
- **User Interface**: A simple interface allowing users to select notes, set tempo, and choose waveform types.
